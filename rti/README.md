# k6-rti-extension
Was written by Lior Gandin and Bailey Hayes. For further information about usage and licensing, please contact me. This is still in its very experimental stages and is not ready for any production use until the production version.

This extension allows you to implement RTI capabilities with your K6 script, potentially enabling you to measure RTI's performance in your system.
Currently the only implement functions are Init(), getRealTimeData(), writeRealTimeData(data: {}).
